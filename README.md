# Yolo Algorithm Output Detection Module 
Yolo algorithm output object detection Module
A Yolo Algorith is an object detection algorithm from the images. In this project the aim is to extract  unstructured information "relevant to different objects captured with a camera images " and convert into structured Data Table.  Unstructured input data are available at 'pkg_dump.txt'.
